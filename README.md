How to Contribute:
</br>
Step 1: Fork this Repository and create a copy with yourself
</br>
Step 2: Create a local branch in your device and test your features in that branch, when you feel the features in the branch are worth comitting to the sacred timeline
</br>
Step 3: Open a pull request from your branch to the Sacred Timeline
</br>
Step 4: After review if the code is accepted into the Sacred Timeline,
</br>
Step 5: Then use the contribute feature in your forked repo to equalize with the sacred timeline,
</br>
Step 6: **NEVER COMMIT YOUR SIDE BRANCHES TO YOUR FORKED REPOSITORY**
</br>
Step 7: Always ensure that your forked repo is in always sync with the Sacred Timeline 
</br>
Step 8: Repeat the above mentioend process for each new feature which you are creating
</br>
Note: If there are any merge conflicts happening with your branch and the sacred Timeline, that won't be resolved, you will need to resolve and send another pull request
</br>
We are doing all of this untill we figure out a way to resolve merge conflicts, until then "THIS IS THE WAY"
</br>
</br></br>
This is the general timeline of adding any feature:</br>
Create a branch for a new feature >>>>> Check if this branch can make commits to the Sacred Timeline >>>>> 
</br></br>if yes, then>>>>> open a pull request and when your branch is added to the Sacred Timeline >>>>> Open the fetch option and make your forked repo equal to Sacred Timeline 

</br></br>If No, then>>>> There is a merge conflict resolve it and then make a pull request >>>>> Merge Conflicts will not be resolved at Sacred Timeline</br>
