<h1>How to Contribute<h1>
  
</br>
Step 1: Fork this Repository and create a copy with yourself
</br>
Step 2: Create a local branch in your device and test your features in that branch, when you feel the features in the branch are worth comitting to the sacred timeline
</br>
Step 3: Open a pull request from your branch to the Sacred Timeline
</br>
Step 4: After review if the code is accepted into the Sacred Timeline,
</br>
Step 5: Then use the contribute feature in your forked repo to equalize with the sacred timeline,
</br>
Step 6: **NEVER COMMIT YOUR SIDE BRANCHES TO YOUR FORKED REPOSITORY**
</br>
Step 7: Always ensure that your forked repo is in always sync with the Sacred Timeline 
</br>
Step 8: Repeat the above mentioend process for each new feature which you are creating
</br>
Note: If there are any merge conflicts happening with your branch and the sacred Timeline, that won't be resolved, you will need to resolve and send another pull request
</br>
We are doing all of this untill we figure out a way to resolve merge conflicts, until then "THIS IS THE WAY"
</br>
</br></br>
This is the general timeline of adding any feature:</br>
Create a branch for a new feature >>>>> Check if this branch can make commits to the Sacred Timeline >>>>> 
</br></br>if yes, then>>>>> open a pull request and when your branch is added to the Sacred Timeline >>>>> Open the fetch option and make your forked repo equal to Sacred Timeline 

</br></br>If No, then>>>> There is a merge conflict resolve it and then make a pull request >>>>> Merge Conflicts will not be resolved at Sacred Timeline</br>

<h1>Naming Conventions/procedure  </h1></br>
<br>1: Give the name to your new branch as "Name/FeatureName"
<br>2: Once the feature is ready create a pull request to ask the sacred timeline to add this new feature to main timeline
<br>3: Once the feature has been accepted in the timeline then procced on to make update your remote repo with the sacred timeline 
<br>4: Once your forked remote is in sync with the sacred timeline, go to android studio terminal and type out "git pull --rebase" 
<br>5: Make sure while typing out the above command you are in your master branch
<br>6: Once your local master is in sync with the sacred timeline, it is safe to delete the old branch and proceed with creating a new branch and creating new features in it
